                    <p>I"m 26 years old. I want to learn something new. I attended Akron Universtiy for 3.5 years, but never completed a degree. I'm a certified pharmacy techincian in the state of Ohio, and worked as one at Drugmart for 4 years. I've served and bartended at my boyfriend's restuarant, 3Palms, in Hudson for the past 5 years. Also I have worked for a company named Aramark for the past 10 years. With employment from Aramark I worked at Blossom Music Center for 6 years and, currently at The Quicken Loans Arena for the past 4 years. While I started as a server with Aramark, I now am in an administrative postion in their money room.</p>
